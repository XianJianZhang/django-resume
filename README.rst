Django Resume
=============

Django Resume is a Django app built to generate a resume on a user's site. 

It includes fields for just about everything one could want on a basic public resume, including jobs with achievements, skillsets with skills (optionally linked to urls), microformats (hResume) support, and a pre-made basic template/ stylesheet with SASS-generated stylesheets.

Portions of this code were previously incorporated into my personal site, ckelly.net, when it was written in Django. I decided to break it out and make it into its own app/ site for others to use if they desire.

TODOs

* create setup.py for installation & verify installable version works
* additional admin features like linking skills to skillsets in inline edits.
* print stylesheet.
